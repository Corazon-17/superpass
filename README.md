**Superpass** is an open source password booster built with [react](https://reactjs.org/). With Superpass, you can generate a strong password from a simple word, with the help of super keys. All you need to do is enter an easy-to-remember words as the base password and keys, and then specify the password length. And **BOOM!!!** you get a super strong password ready to secure your account.
